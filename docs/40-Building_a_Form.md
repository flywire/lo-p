BuildForm.java creates a text-based form at run-time, and
attaches listeners to the controls. Three of the controls
(two list boxes and a grid control) are "data aware" which
means that they obtain their data externally from a
database. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the generated document, with the controls
and data sources labeled.


![](images/40-Building_a_Form-1.png)

Figure 1. The BuildForm.java Generated Document.


The document contains two forms: the default "Form", and "GridForm" holding a
single GridControl. "GridForm" employs the same database as "Form", but interacts
with it in a different way.

Table 1 summarizes which listeners are used with which controls. These are Office
listeners (i.e. subclasses of XEventListener) not Java classes.


|Form Control         |Listeners                      |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
|CommandButton        |XActionListener, XMouseListener|
|Textfield            |XTextListener, XFocusListener  |
|RadioButton, CheckBox|XPropertyChangeListener        |
|ListBox              |XItemListener                  |
|GridControl          |XSelectionChangeListener,      |
|                     |XGridColumnListener            |

Table 1. Controls and Associated Listeners Used by BuildForm.java.


The finished form is saved in "build.odt", which retains the data links (since they're
stored as properties of the form controls), but the listeners are discarded.

The main() function of BuildForm.java creates a text document, and adds form
controls by calling createForm():

=== "java"
    ```java
    // globals
    private static final String DB_FNM = "liang.odb";    // database
    
    private XTextDocument doc;  // for use by the listeners
    
    // in BuildForm.java
    public BuildForm()
    {
      XComponentLoader loader = Lo.loadOffice();
      doc = Write.createDoc(loader);
    
      if (doc == null) {
        System.out.println("Writer doc creation failed");
        Lo.closeOffice();
        System.exit(1);
      }
    
      doc.addEventListener(this);
          // for showing disposing of document (and controls)
      GUI.setVisible(doc, true);
    
      XTextViewCursor tvc = Write.getViewCursor(doc);
      Write.append(tvc, "Building a Form\n");
      Write.endParagraph(tvc);
    
      createForm(doc);
      Lo.dispatchCmd("SwitchControlDesignMode");
        // switch from form design/editing mode to live mode
    
      Lo.waitEnter();
    
      Lo.saveDoc(doc, "build.odt");
      Lo.closeDoc(doc);
      Lo.closeOffice();
    }  // end of BuildForm()
    ```


## 1.  Creating Controls

createForm() makes many calls to Forms.addControl(), and other Forms.addXXX()
methods which indirectly use Forms.addControl(). For example, the call that creates
the "No automatic generation" radio button at the top of the form is:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    XPropertySet props =
         Forms.addControl(doc, "Option",  "No automatic generation",
                          "RadioButton", 106, 11, 50, 6);
    ```

It returns the model's properties since additional values often need to be set after the
control has been created.

Forms.addControl() starts by creating the control's view, utilizing a subclass of the
Shape service, called ControlShape. The relevant part of the service hierarchy is
shown in Figure 2.

![](images/40-Building_a_Form-2.png)

Figure 2. The Shape and ControlShape Services.


Properties in the Shape service define the position, width, and height of the control
inside the form. In the call to Forms.addControl() above, the first pair of numbers,
(106,11), is the intended position, while its width and height are 50 x 6.

After the view has been initialized, the control's model is created by using the string
passed in the method call (e.g. "RadioButton" in this example).

The model and shape are linked together using XControlShape.setControl().

Forms.addControl() is:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static XPropertySet addControl(XComponent doc,
         String name, String label, String compKind, int x, int y,
                                            int width, int height)
    // use the default form, "Form", for the control
    {  return addControl(doc, name, label, compKind,
                                  x, y, width, height, null);  }
    
    
    
    public static XPropertySet addControl(XComponent doc,
          String name, String label, String compKind, int x, int y,
          int width, int height, XNameContainer parentForm)
    {
      XPropertySet modelProps = null;
      try {
        // create a shape to represent the control's view
        XControlShape cShape =
            Lo.createInstanceMSF(XControlShape.class,
                            "com.sun.star.drawing.ControlShape");
    
        // position and size of the shape
        cShape.setSize(new Size(width*100, height * 100));
        cShape.setPosition(new Point(x * 100, y * 100));
    
        // adjust the anchor so that the control is tied to the page
        XPropertySet shapeProps = Lo.qi(XPropertySet.class, cShape);
        TextContentAnchorType eAnchorType =
                           TextContentAnchorType.AT_PARAGRAPH;
        shapeProps.setPropertyValue("AnchorType", eAnchorType);
    
        // create the control's model
        XControlModel cModel =
                   Lo.createInstanceMSF(XControlModel.class,
                       "com.sun.star.form.component." + compKind);
    
        // insert the model into the form (or default to "Form")
        if (parentForm != null)
          parentForm.insertByName(name, cModel);
    
        // link model to the shape
        cShape.setControl(cModel);
    
        // add shape to shapes collection of the doc's draw page
        XDrawPage drawPage = getDrawPage(doc);
        XShapes formShape s= Lo.qi(XShapes.class, drawPage );
        formShapes.add(cShape);
    
        // set Name and Label properties for the model
        modelProps = Lo.qi(XPropertySet.class, cModel);
        modelProps.setPropertyValue("Name", name);
        if (label != null)
          modelProps.setPropertyValue("Label", label);
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
      }
      return modelProps;
    }  // end of addControl()
    ```


The control is added to the form in two ways: firstly the control model is placed in the
parent form with:

=== "java"
    ```java
    parentForm.insertByName(name, cModel);
    ```

then the control shape is inserted into the form's draw page:

=== "java"
    ```java
    XDrawPage drawPage = getDrawPage(doc);
    XShapes formShape s= Lo.qi(XShapes.class, drawPage );
    formShapes.add(cShape);
    ```

The Forms class contains several methods that call addControl() with fixed
arguments, and set various model properties. For example, Forms.addButton() makes
a CommandButton:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static XPropertySet addButton(XComponent doc,
       String name, String label, int x, int y, int width, int height)
    {
      XPropertySet buttonProps = null;
      try {
        buttonProps = addControl(doc, name, label, "CommandButton",
                                 x, y, width, height);
        buttonProps.setPropertyValue("HelpText", name);
    
        // don't want button to be accessible by the "tab" key
        buttonProps.setPropertyValue("Tabstop", false);
    
        // the button should not steal focus when clicked
        buttonProps.setPropertyValue("FocusOnClick", false);
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
      }
    
      return buttonProps;
    }  // end of addButton()
    ```

The "CommandButton" string passed to addControl() means that the model will be an
instance of "com.sun.star.form.component.CommandButton".

Another variant of addControl() is Forms.addLabelledControl() which calls
addControl() twice to attach a text label to the control. For instance, the
"FIRSTNAME" text field is created with:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    
    XPropertySet props =
        Forms.addLabelledControl(doc, "FIRSTNAME", "TextField", 11);
    
    The Forms.addLabelledControl() code:
    
    // in the Forms class
    public static XPropertySet addLabelledControl(XComponent doc,
              String label, String compKind, int y)
    {  return addLabelledControl(doc, label, compKind, 2, y, 6);  }
    
    
    public static XPropertySet addLabelledControl(XComponent doc,
            String label, String compKind, int x, int y, int height)
    {
      XPropertySet ctrlProps = null;
      try {
        // create label (fixed text) control
        String name = label + "_Label";
        XPropertySet labelProps =
           addControl(doc, name, label, "FixedText", x, y, 25, 6);
    
        // create data field control
        ctrlProps = addControl(doc, label, null, compKind,
                   x + 26, y, 40, height);  // to the right
        ctrlProps.setPropertyValue("DataField", label);
    
        // add label props to the control
        ctrlProps.setPropertyValue("LabelControl", labelProps);
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
      }
    
      return ctrlProps;
    }  // end of addLabelledControl()
    ```

The label is of type com.sun.star.form.component.FixedText, and linked to the text
field by setting its "DataField" and "LabelControl" properties.


## 2.  Assigning a Data Source to a Form

The "Form" and "GridForm" forms are both 'data aware', which means they're
connected to external databases. Data awareness is supported by the DataForm
subclass of the Form service, which is also connected to the RowSet and ResultSet
services of Base, as in Figure 3.


![](images/40-Building_a_Form-3.png)

Figure 3. Part of the DataForm Service Hierarchy.


RowSet in the sdbc module supports the "DataSourceName", "Command", and
"CommandType" properties (amongst others). "DataSourceName" is set to the
database's URL, and "Command", and "CommandType" specify how the database
will be queried by the form's controls.

The "Form" form is attached to the "liang.odb" database by:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    XForm defForm = Forms.getForm(doc, "Form");
    Forms.bindFormToTable(defForm,
                             FileIO.fnmToURL("liang.odb"), "Course");
    ```

The code for Forms.bindFormToTable():

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static void bindFormToTable(XForm xForm,
                              String sourceName, String tableName)
    { Props.setProperty(xForm, "DataSourceName", sourceName);
      Props.setProperty(xForm, "Command", tableName); // any table name
      Props.setProperty(xForm, "CommandType", CommandType.TABLE);
    }  // end of bindFormToTable()
    ```

CommandType.TABLE permits SQL SELECT queries to be sent to the data source
by the controls. The "Command" setting can be the name of any table in the database
since the form's two list boxes (see Figure 1) send their own SELECT queries (see
below).

"GridForm" is set up by a call to Forms.bindFormToSQL() which sends a SQL query
to the database to obtain a result set for filling the GridControl table. The code
fragment in BuildForm.java is:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    XNameContainer gridCon = Forms.insertForm("GridForm", doc);
    XForm gridForm = Lo.qi(XForm.class, gridCon);
    
    Forms.bindFormToSQL(gridForm, FileIO.fnmToURL(DB_FNM),
             "SELECT \"firstName\", \"lastName\" FROM \"Student\"");
    ```

The code for Forms.bindFormToSQL():

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static void bindFormToSQL(XForm xForm,
                                     String sourceName, String cmd)
    { Props.setProperty(xForm, "DataSourceName", sourceName);
      Props.setProperty(xForm, "Command", cmd);   // SQL statement
      Props.setProperty(xForm, "CommandType", CommandType.COMMAND);
    }  // end of bindFormToSQL()
    ```

It's not clear to me why the command type must be CommandType.COMMAND in
Forms.bindFormToSQL() since the SELECT query should be processable by
CommandType.TABLE, but using that type cause a run-time error.


## 3.  Creating Data-aware Controls

Some control models have subclasses that support data-awareness, which means they
can access the form's data source using SELECT queries. The different types are
shown in Table 2.


|Control Models         |Type of Access                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
|GridControl            |Fill a table (grid) with data    |
|DatabaseListBox,       |Fill a list with data            |
|DatabaseComboBox       |                                 |
|DatabaseTextField,     |Fill a text field                |
|DatabaseDateField,     |                                 |
|DatabaseTimeField,     |                                 |
|DatabaseNumericField,  |                                 |
|DatabasePatternField,  |                                 |
|DatabaseFormattedField,|                                 |
|DatabaseCurrencyField  |                                 |
|DatabaseRadioButton,   |Specify whether a box is selected|
|DatabaseCheckBox       |or not.                          |
|DatabaseImageControl   |Read an image                    |

Table 2. Data-aware Control Models.


The service hierarchy for these control models is similar to the hierarchy for
DatabaseListBox shown in Figure 4 (except for GridControl which I'll get to shortly).


![](images/40-Building_a_Form-4.png)

Figure 4. Part of the Service Hierarchy for DatabaseListBox.


Figure 4 should be compared with the service hierarchy for an non-data-aware model,
such as CommandButton in Figure 8 of Chapter 39.

The model is initialized by setting properties using the database associated with the
parent form. Exactly which properties should be set depends on the model, but
DatabaseListBox and DatabaseComboBox are fairly straightforward.
"ListSourceType" is set to ListSourceType.SQL, and "ListSource" assigned a string
array containing a SQL command. The command should be a SELECT query which
returns a single column result set.

The two DatabaseListBoxs in BuildForm.java (see Figure 1) are initialized by calling
Forms.addDatabaseList() like so:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    
    Forms.addDatabaseList(doc, "CourseNames",
              "SELECT \"title\" FROM \"Course\"", 90, 90, 20, 6);
    
    Forms.addDatabaseList(doc, "StudNames",
              "SELECT \"lastName\" FROM \"Student\"",  140, 90, 20, 6);
    ```

Forms.addDatabaseList() is:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static XPropertySet addDatabaseList(XComponent doc,
                             String name, String sqlCmd,
                             int x, int y, int width, int height)
    {
      XPropertySet listProps = null;
      try {
        listProps = addControl(doc, name, null, "DatabaseListBox",
                               x, y, width, height);
        // listProps.setPropertyValue("DefaultSelection",
        //                        new short[]{0});  // hangs
        listProps.setPropertyValue("Dropdown", true);
        listProps.setPropertyValue("MultiSelection", false);
        listProps.setPropertyValue("BoundColumn", (short) 0);
    
        // data-aware properties
        listProps.setPropertyValue("ListSourceType",
                                            ListSourceType.SQL);
        listProps.setPropertyValue("ListSource",
                                         new String[] { sqlCmd });
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
      }
      return listProps;
    }  // end of addDatabaseList()
    ```

The DatabaseListBox control is created by calling Forms.addControl(), and then the
model's properties are configured.

Setting the list's default selection to be its first value causes Office to hang, so I've
commented out that line in addDatabaseList() above. This means that the list boxes
appear to be empty until the user clicks on them.


## 4.  Initializing the GridControl

The GridControl is created by calling Forms.addControl() with "GridControl" as the
model string. Also, since this is the only control not inside the "Form" default form,
it's necessary to include a reference to the nameContainer for "GridForm":

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    // add "GridForm" to document
    XNameContainer gridCon = Forms.insertForm("GridForm", doc);
    XForm gridForm = Lo.qi(XForm.class, gridCon);
    
    // "GridForm" uses an SQL query as its data source
    Forms.bindFormToSQL(gridForm, FileIO.fnmToURL(DB_FNM),
              "SELECT \"firstName\", \"lastName\" FROM \"Student\"");
    
    // create grid control inside "GridForm"
    props = Forms.addControl(doc, "SalesTable", null,
                          "GridControl", 2, 100, 100, 40, gridCon);
    ```

"GridForm"s query generates a result set with two columns consisting of first and last
names from the Student table. For this information to be displayed by the grid, two of
the grid's columns must be attached to the two result set columns. This is done by
calling Forms.createGridColumn() twice:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    // get grid control's model
    XControlModel gridModel = Lo.qi(XControlModel.class, props);
    
    // connect grid control's columns to result set
    Forms.createGridColumn(gridModel, "firstName", "TextField", 25);
    Forms.createGridColumn(gridModel, "lastName", "TextField", 25);
    ```

The main service for a grid control model is GridControl in the form.components
module. Part of its hierarchy is shown in Figure 5.


![](images/40-Building_a_Form-5.png)

Figure 5. Part of the GridControl Service Hierarchy.


If Figure 5's hierarchy is compared to those for other models, such as
CommandButton in Figure 8 of Chapter 39, there are some differences. GridControl
inherits the UnoControlModel service, but not through UnoControlGridModel in the
awt module. A search for such a service returns an entire awt.grid sub-module for grid
services, interfaces, and classes, but these aren't utilized by the form's grid control.

The consequence is that GridControl is initialized in a different way from other
models, and listener code becomes a little harder to implement (as we'll see in section
6).

Forms.createGridColumn() employs the XGridColumnFactory interface to link a grid
column to a result set column:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static void createGridColumn(XControlModel gridModel,
            String dataField, String colKind, int width)
    {
      try {
        // column container and factory
        XIndexContainer colContainer =
                        Lo.qi(XIndexContainer.class, gridModel);
        XGridColumnFactory colFactory =
                        Lo.qi(XGridColumnFactory.class, gridModel);
    
        // create the column
        XPropertySet colProps = colFactory.createColumn(colKind);
        colProps.setPropertyValue("DataField", dataField);
                    // connect column to this result set column
        colProps.setPropertyValue("Label", dataField);
        colProps.setPropertyValue("Name", dataField);
        if (width > 0)
          colProps.setPropertyValue("Width", new Integer(width * 10));
    
        // add properties column to container
        colContainer.insertByIndex(colContainer.getCount(), colProps);
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
      }
    }  // end of createGridColumn()
    ```


## 5.  Attaching Listeners

Table 1 shows that nine Office  listeners are used with the controls. To reduce coding,
BuildForm implements their methods:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in BuildForm.java
    public class BuildForm implements XEventListener,
                       XActionListener, XPropertyChangeListener,
                       XTextListener, XFocusListener, XItemListener,
                       XMouseListener, XSelectionChangeListener,
                       XGridColumnListener
    {
      :  // methods for creating the controls ...
    
    
      :  // methods for attaching listeners to the controls ...
    
    
      // listener methods for ...
    
    
      // XEventListener
      public void disposing(EventObject ev)
      { String implName = Info.getImplementationName(ev.Source);
        System.out.println("Disposing: " + implName);
      }
    
    
      // XActionListener
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ev)
      // called when a button has been pressed
      {  System.out.println("Pressed \"" + ev.ActionCommand + "\"");  }
    
    
      : // many more listener methods
    
    }  // end of BuildForm class
    ```

The listener methods are fairly simple, except for the XSelectionChangeListener
attached to the grid control. A button control is attached to a listener like so:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    XPropertySet props = Forms.addButton(doc, "first", "<<", 2, 63, 8);
    listenToButton(props);
    ```

The code in listenToButton() is depicted by Figure 6. All the other "listener attacher"
functions in BuildForm.java work in a similar way.

Figure 6. Attaching a Listener to a Button Control.


The property set passed to listenToButton() is cast to XControlModel, and then
converted into a view using Forms.getControl(). The control is cast to an interface
(such as XButton or XTextComponent) which offers an addXXXListener() method.

The listenToButton() method is:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in BuildForm.java
    public void listenToButton(XPropertySet props)
    {
      XControlModel cModel = Lo.qi(XControlModel.class, props);
      XControl control = Forms.getControl(doc, cModel);
      XButton xButton = Lo.qi(XButton.class, control);
    
      xButton.setActionCommand(Forms.getName(cModel));
      xButton.addActionListener(this);  // use BuildForms as the listener
    }  // end of listenToButton()
    ```


## 6.  Listening for Grid Control Selection Changes

Grid selection changes occur when the user clicks on a cell in the table, as in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Grid Control Selection Change.


Figure 8 shows the grid model and control hierarchy.


![](images/40-Building_a_Form-8.png)

Figure 8. Attaching a Listener to a Grid Control.


The grid model inherits UnoControlModel via FormControlModel. On the control
side, GridControl in the form.control module inherits UnoControl directly.

GridControl supports two listener interfaces – XSelectionSupplier and XGridControl.

Their attachment is handled by listenToGrid(), which is called after the control has
been initialized by createForm():

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    props = Forms.addControl(doc, "SalesTable", null,
                       "GridControl", 2, 100, 100, 40, gridCon);
    XControlModel gridModel = Lo.qi(XControlModel.class, props);
    
    Forms.createGridColumn(gridModel, "firstName", "TextField", 25);
    Forms.createGridColumn(gridModel, "lastName", "TextField", 25);
    listenToGrid(gridModel);
    ```

listenToGrid() is defined as:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in BuildForm.java
    public void listenToGrid(XControlModel gridModel)
    {
      XControl control = Forms.getControl(doc, gridModel);
      XGridControl gc = Lo.qi(XGridControl.class, control);
      gc.addGridControlListener(this);
    
      XSelectionSupplier gridSelection =
                          Lo.qi(XSelectionSupplier.class, gc);
      gridSelection.addSelectionChangeListener(this);
    }  // end of listenToGrid()
    ```

There's no point using XGridControlListener in this example because its
columnChanged() method is only triggered when the data in a column changes, which
never occurs. However, XSelectionChangeListener.selectionChanged() is sent an
event whenever the user's selection changes, which is what we're interested in
reporting.


## 7.  Using the Result Set

The XGridControl interface for GridControl doesn't offer all the methods I need for
announcing selection changes.

XGridControl inherits XGrid and XGridFieldDataSupplier. XGrid can retrieve the
currently selected column, while XGridFieldDataSupplier provides access to the data,
but neither of them offer a way to find the currently selected row. That requires the
result set for the table, which can only be examined by starting from the form level.

Getting to the result set requires a number of casts, the first being from the event
object arriving at the listener to the model that sent it. Forms.getEventControlModel()
does that job:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static XControlModel getEventControlModel(EventObject ev)
    { XControl xControl = Lo.qi(XControl.class, ev.Source);
      return xControl.getModel();
    }
    ```

Another conversion step is from control model to the parent form, which is carried out
by Forms.getFormName():

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Forms class
    public static String getFormName(XControlModel cModel)
    { XChild xChild = Lo.qi(XChild.class, cModel);
      XNamed xNamed = Lo.qi(XNamed.class, xChild.getParent());
      return xNamed.getName();
    }
    ```

selectionChanged() utilizes getEventControlModel() and getFormName() to convert
an event object to a form. Finally, XForm is cast to a result set using the hierarchy in

![](images/40-Building_a_Form-3.png)

Figure 3.


=== "java"
    ```java
    // in BuildForm.java
    public void selectionChanged(EventObject ev)
    {
      XControlModel cModel = Forms.getEventControlModel(ev);
      XGridControl gc =  Lo.qi(XGridControl.class, ev.Source);
      System.out.println("Grid " + Forms.getName(cModel) +
                         " column: " + gc.getCurrentColumnPosition());
    
      String formName = Forms.getFormName(cModel);
      XForm gForm = Forms.getForm(doc, formName);
      XResultSet rs = Lo.qi(XResultSet.class, gForm);
      try {
        System.out.println("    row: " + rs.getRow());
      }
      catch (com.sun.star.uno.Exception e) {
        System.out.println(e);
      }
    }  // end of selectionChanged()
    ```

selectionChanged() jumps through these hoops in order to print the currently selected
column and row in the table. The selected column is obtained by calling
XGridControl.getCurrentColumnPosition(), and the current row comes from
XResultSet.getRow().


## 8.  Some Bugs

My first version of BuildForm.java had a few problems which caused it to hang.

The most serious occurred when I tried to include an image button in the form. The
relevant lines in createForm() in BuildForm.java were:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in createForm() in BuildForm.java...
    props = Forms.addControl(doc, "Smiley", null,
                                     "ImageButton", 90, 80, 10, 10);
    props.setPropertyValue("ImageURL", FileIO.fnmToURL("smiley.png"));
    ```

The button would sometimes appear at the correct position, but cause Office to hang
when pressed, and sometimes the button wouldn't appear at all. After failing to find an
answer online, I commented out the above lines. If anyone knows of a solution please
contact me.

A more minor issue is the initial lack of text in the DatabaseListBoxs. In the original
Forms.addDatabaseList(), the list text was set with:

=== "java"
    ```java
    listProps.setPropertyValue("DefaultSelection", new short[]{0});
    ```

This line caused Office to hang, and once again I 'solved' the problem by commenting
out the code. The unfortunate side-effect is that now the list box's text is blank until
the user clicks on the list.
