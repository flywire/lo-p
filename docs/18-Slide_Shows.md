This chapter focuses on ways to programmatically control
slide shows. If you're unfamiliar with what Impress offers
in this regard, then chapter 9 of the Impress user guide
gives a good overview.

Creating and controlling slide shows employs properties
in the Presentation service, and methods in the
XSlideShowController interface (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. The Slide Show Presentation Services.


Two elements of slide shows not shown in Figure 1 are slide transition effects (e.g.
have the next slide fade into view, replacing the current one), and shape animation
effects (e.g. have some text whoosh in from the bottom of the screen). These effects
are mostly controlled by setting properties – transition properties are in the
com.sun.star.presentation.DrawPage service, animations properties in
com.sun.star.presentation.Shape.


## 1.  Starting a Slide Show

The BasicShow.java example shows how a program can start a slide show, and then
let the user progress through the presentation by clicking on a slide, pressing the space
bar, or using the arrow keys.

While the slide show is running, BasicShow.java suspends, but wakes up when the
user exits the show. This can occur when he presses the ESC key, or clicks on the
slide show's "click to exit" screen. BasicShow then closes the document and shuts
down Office.

The main() function:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in BasicShow.java
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
      XComponentLoader loader = Lo.loadOffice();
      XComponent doc = Lo.openDoc(args[0], loader);
      if (doc == null) {
        System.out.println("Could not open "+ args[0]);
        Lo.closeOffice();
        return;
      }
    
      GUI.setVisible(doc, true);
         // slideshow start() crashes if the doc is not visible
    
      XPresentation2 show = Draw.getShow(doc);
      Props.showObjProps("Slide show", show);
      show.start();
      XSlideShowController sc = Draw.getShowController(show);
      Draw.waitEnded(sc);   // BasicShow waits for the user
                            // to finish the slide show
      Lo.closeDoc(doc);
      Lo.closeOffice();
    }  // end of main()
    ```

The document is opened in the normal way and a slide show object created by calling
Draw.getShow(), which is defined as:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    public static XPresentation2 getShow(XComponent doc)
    {
      XPresentationSupplier ps = Lo.qi(XPresentationSupplier.class, doc);
      return Lo.qi(XPresentation2.class, ps.getPresentation());
    }
    ```

The call to Props.showObjProps() in main() prints the properties associated with the
slide show, most of which are defined in the Presentation service (see Figure 1):

```
Slide show Properties
  AllowAnimations == true
  CustomShow ==
  Display == 0
  FirstPage ==
  IsAlwaysOnTop == false
  IsAutomatic == false
  IsEndless == false
  IsFullScreen == true
  IsMouseVisible == false
  IsShowAll == true
  IsShowLogo == false
  IsTransitionOnClick == true
  Pause == 10
  StartWithNavigator == false
  UsePen == false
```

The default values for these properties are sufficient for most presentations.

The slide show is started by calling XPresentation.show() and, although the call
returns immediately, it may be a few 100 milliseconds before the presentation appears
on screen. If you have more than one monitor, one of them will be allocated a
"Presenter Console" window.

This short period while the slide show initializes can cause a problem if the
XSlideShowController instance is requested too quickly – null will be returned if the
slide show hasn't finished being created. Draw.getShowController() handles this issue
by waiting:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    public static XSlideShowController getShowController(
                                            XPresentation2 show)
    // keep trying to get the slide show controller
    {
      XSlideShowController sc = show.getController();
         // may return null if executed too quickly after start of show
    
      int numTries = 1;
      if ((sc == null) && (numTries < 4)) {  // try 3 times
        Lo.delay(1000);  // give the slide show time to start
        numTries++;
        sc = show.getController();
      }
      if (sc == null)
        System.out.println("Could not obtain slide show controller");
      return sc;
    }  // end of XSlideShowController getShowController()
    ```

getShowController() tries to obtain the controller three times before giving up and
returning null.

The XSlideShowController interface gives the programmer much greater control over
the slide show, including the ability to change the slide being displayed, and monitor
and control the slide show state. Two topics I won't cover here are how
XSlideShowController can assign listeners to the slide show (of type
XSlideShowListener), and how to utilize the XSlideShow interface.

Back in BasicShow.java, the main() function suspends by calling Draw.waitEnded();
the idea is that the program will sleep until the human presenter ends the slide show.
waitEnded() is implemented using XSlideShowController:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    public static void waitEnded(XSlideShowController sc)
    {
      while (sc.getCurrentSlideIndex() != -1) //presentation not ended
        Lo.delay(1000);
      System.out.println("End of presentation detected");
    }
    ```

XSlideShowController.getCurrentSlideIndex() normally returns a slide index (i.e. 0 or
greater), but when the slide show has finished it returns -1. waitEnded() keeps polling
for this value, sleeping for a second between each test.


## 2.  Play and End a Slide Show Automatically

The AutoShow.java example removes the need for a presenter to click on a slide to
progress to the next one, and terminates the show itself after the last slide had been
displayed:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in AutoShow.java
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
      XComponentLoader loader = Lo.loadOffice();
      XComponent doc = Lo.openDoc(args[0], loader);
      if (doc == null) {
        System.out.println("Could not open "+ args[0]);
        Lo.closeOffice();
        return;
      }
    
      GUI.setVisible(doc, true);
    
      // fast automatic change between all the slides
      XDrawPage[] slides = Draw.getSlidesArr(doc);
      for(XDrawPage slide : slides)
        Draw.setTransition(slide, FadeEffect.NONE, AnimationSpeed.FAST,
                                         Draw.AUTO_CHANGE, 1);
    
      XPresentation2 show = Draw.getShow(doc);
      show.start();
    
      XSlideShowController sc = Draw.getShowController(show);
    
      Draw.waitLast(sc, 3000);  // terminate 3 seconds after the
                                // last slide has been shown
      System.out.println("Ending the slide show");
      sc.deactivate();
      show.end();
    
      Lo.closeDoc(doc);
      Lo.closeOffice();
    }  // end of main()
    ```

#### Automatic Slide Transitioning

The automated transition between slides is configured by calling Draw.setTransition()
on every slide in the deck:

=== "java"
    ```java
    Draw.setTransition(slide, FadeEffect.NONE,
                              AnimationSpeed.FAST,
                              Draw.AUTO_CHANGE, 1);
    ```

setTransition() combines the setting of four slide properties: "Effect", "Speed",
"Change", and "Duration":

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    public static void setTransition(XDrawPage currSlide,
                 FadeEffect fadeEffect, AnimationSpeed speed,
                 int change, int duration)
    { try {
        XPropertySet props = Lo.qi(XPropertySet.class, currSlide);
        props.setPropertyValue("Effect", fadeEffect);
        props.setPropertyValue("Speed", speed);
        props.setPropertyValue("Change", change);
        props.setPropertyValue("Duration", duration);  // in seconds
      }
      catch (Exception e)
      {  System.out.println("Could not set slide transition");  }
    }  // end of setTransition()
    ```

Slide transition properties (such as "Effect", "Speed", "Change", and "Duration") are
defined in the com.sun.star.presentation.DrawPage service. However, the possible
values for "Effect" are stored in an enumeration listed at the end of the
com.sun.star.presentation module (use `lodoc presentation module`, and scroll to
the bottom of the page); Figure 2 shows the enum.


![](images/18-Slide_Shows-2.png)

Figure 2. The FadeEffect Enum.


If you click on a word in the enum, then the browser follows a link to more
information.

The "Speed" property is used to set the speed of a slide transition, and its values are
also stored in an enum in the com.sun.star.presentation package. There are three
possible settings: AnimationSpeed.SLOW,  AnimationSpeed.MEDIUM, and
AnimationSpeed.FAST.

The "Change" property specifies how a transition is triggered. The property can take
one of three integer values, which aren't defined by an enum for some reason. Instead,
the programmer can use constants defined in my Draw class:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    // slide show change constants
    public static final int CLICK_ALL_CHANGE = 0;
    public static final int AUTO_CHANGE = 1;
    public static final int CLICK_PAGE_CHANGE = 2;
    ```

The default behavior is represented by 0 (`Draw.CLICK_ALL_CHANGE`) which requires
the presenter to click on a slide to change it, and a click is also need to trigger any
shape animations on the page. A value of 2 (`Draw.CLICK_PAGE_CHANGE`)  relieves the
presenter from clicking to trigger shape animations, but he still needs to activate a
slide transition manually. AutoShow.java passes `Draw.AUTO_CHANG`E to
Draw.setTransition() which causes all the animations and transitions to execute
automatically.

The "Duration" property is specified in seconds and refers to how long the current
slide stays on display before the transition effect begins. This is different from the
"Speed" property which refers to how quickly a transition is performed.


#### Finishing Automatically

The other aspect of this automated slide show is making it stop when the last slide has
been displayed. This is implemented by Draw.waitLast():

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    public static void waitLast(XSlideShowController sc, int delay)
    {
      int numSlides = sc.getSlideCount();
      while (sc.getCurrentSlideIndex() < numSlides-1) {
                     // has not yet reached the last slide
        Lo.delay(500);
      }
      Lo.delay(delay);
    }  // end of waitLast()
    ```

waitLast() keeps checking the current slide index and sleeps until the last slide in the
deck is reached. It then goes to sleep one last time, to give the final slide time to be
seen by the user.


## 3.  Play a Slide Show Repeatedly

Another common kind of automated slide show is one that plays the show repeatedly,
only terminating when the presenter steps in and presses the ESC key. This only
requires four lines to be changed in AutoShow.java, shown in bold below:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in AutoShow.java
      :
    XPresentation2 show = Draw.getShow(doc);
    Props.showObjProps("Slide show", show);
    Props.setProperty(show, "IsEndless", true);
    Props.setProperty(show, "Pause", 0);
                       // no pause before repeating
    show.start();
    
    XSlideShowController sc = Draw.getShowController(show);
    
    // Draw.waitLast(sc, 3000);
            // commented out; replaced by the next line
    Draw.waitEnded(sc);
    System.out.println("Ending the slide show");
    sc.deactivate();
    show.end();
      :
    ```

The "IsEndless" property turns on slide show cycling, and "Pause" indicates how long
the black "Click to exit" screen is displayed before the show restarts.

Draw.waitEnded() is the same as before – it makes AutoShow.java suspend until the
user clicks on the exit screen or presses the ESC key.


## 4.  Play a  Custom Slide Show

A custom slide show is a display sequence other than the usual one that starts with the
first slide and moves linearly through to the last. A named 'play list' of pages must be
created, consisting of references to slides in the deck. The list can point to the slides in
any order, and may reference a slide more than once.

Draw.buildPlayList() creates the named play list using three arguments: the slide
document, an array of slide indices which represents the intended playing sequence,
and a name for the list. For example:

=== "java"
    ```java
    int[] slideIdxs = new int[] {5, 6, 7, 8};
    XNameContainer playList =
             Draw.buildPlayList(doc, slideIdxs, "ShortPlay");
    ```

This creates a play list called "ShortPlay" which will show the slides with indices 5, 6,
7, and 8 (note: the first slide has index 0). Draw.buildPlayList is used in the
CustomShow.java example:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in CustomShow.java
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
      XComponentLoader loader = Lo.loadOffice();
      XComponent doc = Lo.openDoc("algs.odp", loader);
      if (doc == null) {
        System.out.println("Could not open algs.odp");
        Lo.closeOffice();
        return;
      }
    
      GUI.setVisible(doc, true);
    
      int[] slideIdxs = new int[] {5, 6, 7, 8};
      XNameContainer playList =
          Draw.buildPlayList(doc, slideIdxs, "ShortPlay");
    
      XPresentation2 show = Draw.getShow(doc);
      Props.setProperty(show, "CustomShow", "ShortPlay");
    
      show.start();
      XSlideShowController sc = Draw.getShowController(show);
      Draw.waitEnded(sc);
    
      Lo.closeDoc(doc);
      Lo.closeOffice();
    }  // end of main()
    ```

The play list is installed by setting the "CustomShow" property in the slide show. The
rest of the code in CustomShow.java is similar to the BasicShow.java example.


#### Creating a Play List Using Containers

The most confusing part of Draw.buildPlayList() is its use of two containers to hold
the play list:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // part of buildPlayList() in the Draw class
          :
    // get name container for the slide show
    XNameContainer playList = Draw.getPlayList(doc);
    
    // get factory from the container
    XSingleServiceFactory xFactory =
                Lo.qi(XSingleServiceFactory.class, playList);
    
    // use factory to make an index container
    XIndexContainer slidesCon =  Lo.qi(XIndexContainer.class,
                                       xFactory.createInstance());
          :
    ```

An index container is created by XSingleServiceFactory.createInstance(), which
requires a factory instance. This factory is most conveniently obtained from an
existing container, namely the one for the slide show. That's obtained by
Draw.getPlayList():

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    public static XNameContainer getPlayList(XComponent doc)
    // get a name container for the play list
    {
      XCustomPresentationSupplier cpSupp =
                Lo.qi(XCustomPresentationSupplier.class, doc);
      return cpSupp.getCustomPresentations();
    }
    ```

Draw.buildPlayList() fills the index container with references to the slides, and then
places it inside the name container:

=== "java"
    ```java
    /* store the index container under the play list name
       in the name container */
    playList.insertByName(customName, slidesCon);
    ```

In other words, the play list is a name container holding a named index container.

The rest of buildPlayList() is straightforward:

=== "java"
    ```java
    // in the Draw class
    public static XNameContainer buildPlayList(XComponent doc,
                              int[] slideIdxs, String customName)
    {
      // get a name container for the play list
      XNameContainer playList = Draw.getPlayList(doc);
    
      try {
        // create an index container for the play list
        XSingleServiceFactory xFactory =
                Lo.qi(XSingleServiceFactory.class, playList);
        XIndexContainer slidesCon =  Lo.qi(XIndexContainer.class,
                                          xFactory.createInstance());
    
        /* index container is assigned slide references
           whose indices come from slideIdxs
        */
        System.out.println("Building play list using: ");
        for(int j=0; j < slideIdxs.length; j++) {
          XDrawPage slide = Draw.getSlide(doc, slideIdxs[j]);
          if (slide != null) {
            slidesCon.insertByIndex(j, slide);
            System.out.println("  Slide " + slideIdxs[j]);
          }
        }
    
        /* store the index container under the play list name
           in the name container */
        playList.insertByName(customName, slidesCon);
        System.out.println("Playlist has name: " + customName + "\n");
        return playList;
      }
      catch (com.sun.star.uno.Exception e)
      {  System.out.println("Unable to build play list: " + e);
         return null;
      }
    }  // end of buildPlayList()
    ```

The for-loop employs the array of indices to get references to the slides via
Draw.getSlide(). Each reference is added to the index container.
